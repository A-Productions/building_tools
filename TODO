REMOVE ALL UNSTABLE FEATURES
- railing and balcony modules extremely unstable and poorly designed
- work on more robust implementations in dev branch
- keep master with stable features only

- roof is also abit unstable esp hip roof and straight skeleton

SLANTED FACES:
  Window tool should allow  for slanted faces

NGON VALIDATION AND SOLVE
  It may be useful to try and provide solution for simple ngon cases.

  For instance, if ngon has two top edges, create a new horizontal edge
  and slide it to the top. This can be repeated as nessesary for remaining
  sides until a quad is formed.

  If the ngon for instance has all sides with multiple edges, skip and throw
  warning.

REMOVE ALL DEAD CODE / UNREACHABLE
  - part of refactoring


ROOF:
    - XXX support gable roof for complex shapes
    - support adding roofs to faces that have boundary geometry e.g for patio

STAIRS:
    - bridge edge loops to fill gaps caused by sloping

    - if landing is provided, perhaps option to slim down the stairs
      should be there

      plus, when 'move_slabface_to_wall' is used, and stair direction is
      not front, stairs intersect with the slab


MATERIAL API:
    - create presets for default materials (FLAT / PBR)

    - XXX LONG TERM:
        Since the addon operates in editmode, editing multiple buildings
        may pose challenges with the current facemap system.

        EITHER - only allow creation of one building for each blender object
        OR - figure out how to store facemaps for multiple buildings in the
             same object.

        THIS NEEDS FURTHER CONSIDERATION!!


REFACTOR AND STYLE:
    - speaking of straight skeleton - refactor to work better with blender types eg. Vector


UI:
    - try an minify properties that take too much space esp door and window
    - create tools for all the operators and add to the top bar


#???
    - Circular floorplan doesn't have any real use ??? Remove!
