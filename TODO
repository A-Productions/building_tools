BUG::
    Door Array and Louver fill causes invalid geom/index error

GENERAL:
    - keep a reference to an objects building properties
    - replace all [-1] with pop where possible

DOOR:
    - add attachments e.g door-handles
    - add arch doors

FLOORPLANS:
    - add support for floorplan with holes

ROOF:
    - fix hiproof error for outset property
    - support for hip-roof with holes

RAILING:
    - fix gaps caused by railing not reaching walls due to slabs

STAIRS:
    - add railing types - wall and rails

BALCONY:
    - create combined for faces that share an edge

MATERIAL API:

    - current plan is keep a record of faces(indices) for each tool
    - add a material tab
    - create presets for default materials (FLAT / PBR)
    - apply the materials to the faces based on where they belong

    - for material editing;
        - FLAT - just a diffuse shader with color
        - let user change color from the material tab

        - PBR - Principled with diffuse, normal and roughness
        - let user change textures
        - let user change parameters - roughness, metallic factors



REFACTOR AND STYLE:
    - speaking of straight skeleton - refactor to work better with blender types eg. Vector


UI:
    - try an minify properties that take too much space esp door and window
    - create tools for all the operators and add to the top bar


#???
    - Circular floorplan doesn't have any real use ??? Remove!
