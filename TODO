ROOF:
    - XXX support gable roof for complex shapes

STAIRS:
    - bridge edge loops to fill gaps caused by sloping


FLOORS:
    - add option to add extra roof slab (may be useful)

    - COLUMNS : I keep dismissing this feature and then running into
                multiple usecases for it e.g support beams for patio roof,
                plus keeping a uniform look for buildings (slabs and columns)

MATERIAL API:
    - create presets for default materials (FLAT / PBR)

    - XXX LONG TERM:
        Since the addon operates in editmode, editing multiple buildings
        may pose challenges with the current facemap system.

        EITHER - only allow creation of one building for each blender object
        OR - figure out how to store facemaps for multiple buildings in the
             same object.

        THIS NEEDS FURTHER CONSIDERATION!!


REFACTOR AND STYLE:
    - speaking of straight skeleton - refactor to work better with blender types eg. Vector


UI:
    - try an minify properties that take too much space esp door and window
    - create tools for all the operators and add to the top bar


#???
    - Circular floorplan doesn't have any real use ??? Remove!
