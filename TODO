RAILING:
    - fix gaps caused by railing not reaching walls due to slabs

ROOF:
    - XXX support gable roof for complex shapes
    - fix: gable roof uses highest z coordinates for calculations,
            may not be wise to assume a roof is always being created
            on the highest face of the building e.g for patio roof
    - gable roof : option to disable roof hangs may come in handy

FLOORS:
    - add option to add extra roof slab (may be useful)

    - COLUMNS : I keep dismissing this feature and then running into
                multiple usecases for it e.g support beams for patio roof,
                plus keeping a uniform look for buildings (slabs and columns)

MATERIAL API:
    - UI option to set a material for given facemap

    - create presets for default materials (FLAT / PBR)
    - apply the materials to the faces based on where they belong

    - for material editing;
        - FLAT - just a diffuse shader with color
        - let user change color from the material tab

        - PBR - Principled with diffuse, normal and roughness
        - let user change textures
        - let user change parameters - roughness, metallic factors

    - XXX LONG TERM:
        Since the addon operates in editmode, editing multiple buildings
        may pose challenges with the current facemap system.

        EITHER - only allow creation of one building for each blender object
        OR - figure out how to store facemaps for multiple buildings in the
             same object.

        THIS NEEDS FURTHER CONSIDERATION!!


REFACTOR AND STYLE:
    - speaking of straight skeleton - refactor to work better with blender types eg. Vector


UI:
    - try an minify properties that take too much space esp door and window
    - create tools for all the operators and add to the top bar


#???
    - Circular floorplan doesn't have any real use ??? Remove!
