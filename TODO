    - create presets for default materials (FLAT / PBR)
    - apply the materials to the faces based on where they belong

    - for material editing;
        - FLAT - just a diffuse shader with color
        - let user change color from the material tab

        - PBR - Principled with diffuse, normal and roughness
        - let user change textures
        - let user change parameters - roughness, metallic factors



REFACTOR AND STYLE:
    - add docstrings to modules without them
    - finish refactor to make functions 30 lines or less esp for XXX_types.py and utils (straight_skeleton)
    - speaking of straight skeleton - refactor to work better with blender types eg. Vector


UI:
    - try an minify properties that take too much space esp door and window
    - create tools for all the operators and add to the top bar
